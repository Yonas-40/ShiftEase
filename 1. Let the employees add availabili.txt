✅ 1. Let the employees add availability days on the shift calendar instead of adding shifts. cuz employees shouldn't have the possibility to add any shifts to other employees.
✅ 2. MonthelyWorkingHours should just show the working hours for the signed in user(right now it shows all employees working hours)
3. The newly added employees should get an email with their account information like password and email and other information that has been added by the manager
