    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Environment Variables: Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and populate your database URL and JWT secret.
4.  Database Setup: Run migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
5.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
